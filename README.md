#### Overview

Roller coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! They take you up high, drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before returning to a stop. Today you will be taking control back from the roller coasters and visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and roller coaster statistics.

#### Project Goals

Create several data visualizations that will give insight into the world of roller coasters.
